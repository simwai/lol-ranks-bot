# lol-ranks-bot

A Discord bot that allows users to verify their League of Legends summoner name and assigns roles based on their rank/elo in the game. Users must initiate the verification process themselves, and upon successful verification, the bot will grant them the appropriate rank role within the Discord server.

5. Adjust the config values by editing `config.json`
6. Start the bot using PM2 by running `pm2 start src/index.js --name lol-ranks-bot`
7. To ensure PM2 restarts the bot after reboots, run `pm2 save`

## How the Bot Works

- Users trigger the verification process by a command in Discord.
- The bot verifies the user's League of Legends summoner name.
- Once verified, the bot checks the user's rank/elo in League of Legends.
- The bot assigns a corresponding rank role and verified role to the user in the Discord server based on their League of Legends rank/elo.
- The bot keeps the lol ranks of the verified users up-to-date by running periodically.
- The bot does not automatically assign roles to all users; each user must initiate the verification process.
